========== Question ==========  

### Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`

- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

What can we do when we encounter a repeating character while expanding our
window?

A) Remove the repeating character from our data structure and continue
expanding.

B) Shrink the window from the left until the repeating character is no longer in
the window.

C) Discard the current window and start a new window from the next character.  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

When we encounter a repeating character, it means we need to shrink the window
from the left until the repeating character is no longer in the window, as we
are searching for substrings without repeating characters.

========== Id ==========  
75
