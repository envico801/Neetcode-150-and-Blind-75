========== Question ==========  

### Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]` might become:

- `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]` if it was rotated `4` times.

- `[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

  Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time
  results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the
minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`

- `1 <= n <= 5000`

- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`

- All the integers of `nums` are unique.

- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

Now consider a sorted array that has been rotated at an unknown index. What is
the time complexity of the _simplest_ (but non-optimal) solution to find the
minimum element in this array?

A) O(n)

B) O(log n)

C) O(n^2)

D) O(1)  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

The simplest solution would be to perform a linear search, which has a time
complexity of O(n).

========== Id ==========  
107
