==================== Question ====================  

### You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

_Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it._

**Example 1:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1-&#x26;gt;4-&#x26;gt;5,
  1-&#x26;gt;3-&#x26;gt;4,
  2-&#x26;gt;6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1-&#x26;gt;1-&#x26;gt;2-&#x26;gt;3-&#x26;gt;4-&#x26;gt;4-&#x26;gt;5-&#x26;gt;6
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Example 2:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: lists = []
Output: []
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Example 3:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Constraints:**

- `k == lists.length`

- `0 <= k <= 10^4`

- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`

- `10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`

- `lists[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.

- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

---

Given that all individual linked lists are already sorted, how can you take advantage of this to improve the time complexity?

A) By using a sorting algorithm that is more efficient on nearly sorted lists

B) By using a two-pointer technique to find pairs of nodes that sum to a target

C) By merging the linked lists two at a time

D) By using a priority queue to select the next smallest node  

==================== Answer ====================  

**Answer**: D

Since all individual linked lists are sorted, you can use a priority queue (also known as a min-heap) to efficiently select the next smallest node from the heads of all the linked lists.
